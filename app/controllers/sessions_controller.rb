# http://localhost:3000/auth routes to a sessions controller. 
# In the sessions controller, we use the Client ID and Client Secret, 
# as well as the code param by sending them in a POST back to GitHub. 
# If this information is correct, GitHub will respond with an access_token.

# In sessions_controller.rb, write a create method. 
# This method should receive GitHub's code parameter and should use it in conjunction 
# with your Client ID and Client Secret to send a POST request to GitHub. 
# The base URL this time will be https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token.
